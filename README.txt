Cycle conserving EDF scheduling simulator with GUI

This Python program simulates the Cycle conserving Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling algorithm using a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) and outputs the results in the form of bar charts. The program is designed to provide
users with a visual representation of the scheduling algorithm, allowing them to see how the algorithm assigns tasks
to resources and how it manages to meet the deadlines for each task.

How to run the program
To run the program, you must run the OutputChartsFINAL.py file, which is the main file for the program.
Make sure that you have Python 3.11 installed on your computer and all the necessary dependencies installed before running the program.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the program:

Python 3.11
matplotlib
tkinter
numpy

You can install the dependencies using pip:

pip install matplotlib tkinter numpy

Usage
To use the program, simply run the OutputChartsFINAL.py file. This will launch the GUI, which allows you to specify the
number of tasks and p-states, as well as the execution time and deadline for each task.

Once you have entered the required information, click the "Schedule" button to run the scheduling algorithm.
The program will output the results in the form of bar charts, showing how the tasks are assigned to resources over time.

About Cycle conserving EDF scheduling algorithm
Cycle conserving EDF scheduling algorithm is a variation of the EDF scheduling algorithm that is designed to ensure that
the schedule repeats after a fixed number of cycles. This algorithm is commonly used in real-time systems, where tasks
have strict deadlines and must be scheduled to meet those deadlines.
